        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more
        so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
        the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
        12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
        I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure 
        from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
        by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
        curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
        for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
        to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to
        it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land
        a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
